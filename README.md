# DNA-Classification-Challenge-With-Kernel-Methods
The data challenge is a project taken to climax the kernel methods in machine learning course at AMMI-2020, aimed at the implementation of machine learning algorithms to gain understanding and further adapt them to structural data (DNA sequence data). In this report, we (Aissatou &amp; I) present our approach to the challenge which was hosted on Kaggle with the goal of predict- ing whether a DNA sequence region is binding site to a specific transcription factor or not. Our best result ranked 1st on the private leader board with a score of 71.20% .
